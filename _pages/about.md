My research focuses on philosophical issues regarding the use of machine learning (ML) in scientific practice, including what concepts of novelty best characterize how ML contributes to scientific knowledge. I also research challenges of reliability in scientific discovery with ML, such as how human inductive assumptions regarding model transfer are justified. I have relevant publications and several conference contributions in philosophy of science and AI ethics.

I am currently a guest researcher in the Ethics & Philosophy Lab, part of the [Cluster of Excellence: ML for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/ethics-philosophy-lab/overview/) (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen). My research here is supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst).
