My research focuses on what kinds of novelties machine learning (ML) generates for science, and challenges of reliability in scientific discovery with ML. I also explore related ethical issues concerning how values impact model design. I have relevant publications and several conference contributions in philosophy of science and AI ethics.

I am currently a guest researcher in the Ethics & Philosophy Lab, part of the [Cluster of Excellence: ML for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/ethics-philosophy-lab/overview/) (Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen).
